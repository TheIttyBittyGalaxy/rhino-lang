-   **Uses struct/object semantics**, as opposed to value/reference/pointer semantics.
-   **Has tagged unions as part of the type system**, where a single type can be present in any number of unions.
-   **Context instead of classes**, for managing 'regional' data (as opposed to 'global' or 'local' data).
